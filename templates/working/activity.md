# Activity Log

Chronological record of skill invocations and proposal state changes. Every content-producing skill appends one line on completion. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <skill-name> [<mode>] — <one-line summary> → <output path>
```

Newest entries at the bottom. Read this file (or run `/status`) when returning to a proposal after a break.

**Companion file:** `ai-runs.jsonl` (same directory) — one JSON Lines entry per AI model invocation for token/cost tracking. See [`reference/schemas/ai-run.schema.json`](../../reference/schemas/ai-run.schema.json) for the schema.
